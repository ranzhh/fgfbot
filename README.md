# Free Games Bot
A quick Discord.py bot to check for new posts on the [FreeGameFindings](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/) subreddit and post them to a given Discord channel. Feel free to submit PRs to improve the output.

# Usage:
Create a new virtual environment, install the requirements, fill in the configuration file with your desired parameters, rename it to config.json. Then run bot.py. Done.
